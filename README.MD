# Phonetic Fanatic
Vocabulary is a key factor in the development of a childs reading and writing skills.  I homeschool my children and my son hates using the paper flash cards.  I realized that if I put the words on a note in his phone he would study them.   I created this app to help him, and kids like him practice their vocabulary words.
